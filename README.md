# boilerplate
In which I finally start writing javascript in the "modern" way.
Using a static type checker, testing framework, and an automated transform, packaging (CommonJS), and minification pipeline.
static type check: flow
testing framework: jest
packaging: browserify
minification: uglify
ES6, JSX, type transform: reactify
autmation: watchify
